I’m Carmine De Stefano, and most of the time, I do things on a computer. Born in 1997, I grew up in Potenza and have been living in Turin for a few years now. I love reading all kinds of books and writing short poems.  
I can’t stand pointless labels or plot holes. Whenever I get the chance, you’ll find me wandering through museums, parks, or dimly lit churches. The rest of the time, I try to make the most of my insatiable curiosity.

I’m not a fan of long-winded explanations, so I’ll let my work from recent years speak for itself.  
Thanks for stopping by!
