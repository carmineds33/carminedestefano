I’m Carmine De Stefano, a curious soul who spends most of his time working on a computer. Born in 1997 in Potenza, I’ve been living in Turin for a few years now. I’m passionate about reading all kinds of books and writing short poems.
I’m not a fan of pointless labels or plot holes. In my free time, you’ll often find me exploring museums, strolling through parks, or soaking in the quiet beauty of dimly lit churches. The rest of the time, I’m chasing my endless curiosity.

Feel free to explore the rest of my blog—thanks for stopping by!
